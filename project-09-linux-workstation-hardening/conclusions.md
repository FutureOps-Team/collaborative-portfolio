## Conclusions & Lessons Learned

This project demonstrates that effective system hardening does not require complex tools or enterprise infrastructure. Applying security fundamentals consistently has a significant impact on reducing attack surface.

Key takeaways include:
- Order matters when applying hardening controls, especially for access services like SSH.
- Desktop environments represent a valid attack surface and must be included in security scope.
- Host-based firewalls and service reduction are critical even on non-server systems.
- Hardening requires balancing security and usability while maintaining system stability.

From a defensive perspective, this project reinforces the importance of documentation, validation, and understanding system behavior rather than blindly applying configurations.

The skills applied in this project directly map to Blue Team, SOC Tier 1–2, and IT security roles.
